# Project Overview
> What you're looking at is a ghost, once alive but now deceased. Once upon a time, it was a cornhole stadium that housed a professional cornhole league club known as the Evanston Zephyrs. Now it houses nothing but memories and a wind that stirs in the high grass of what was once an outfield, a wind that sometimes bears a faint, ghostly resemblance to the roar of a crowd that once sat here. We're back in time now, when the Evanston Zephyrs were still a part of the American League, and this mausoleum of memories was an honest-to-Pete stadium. But since this is strictly a story of make believe, it has to start this way: once upon a time, in Evanston, Illinois, it was tryout day. And though he's not yet on the field, you're about to meet a most unusual fella, a one-armed player named Sawyer. (adapted from the opening narration of the _The Twilight Zone_ episode ["The Mighty Casey"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mighty_Casey))

This project includes three major parts:
1. [Computer vision](#computer-vision)
2. [Throwing](#throwing)
3. [Manipulation](#manipulation)

# Instructions to run code
General ROS directions:
1. Set up workspace and clone repo:
```
mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/ME495-EmbeddedSystems/the-mighty-sawyer.git
```
2. catkin and source
```
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
```
3. Launching project
```
roslaunch the_mighty_sawyer play_cornhole.launch
```

# Computer Vision

# Throwing
Since Sawyer is not the fastest robot, the throwing motion attempts to leverage as many joints as possible while also taking advantage of the full arm length. Sawyer executes an overhand throw, by positioning the arm behind it self. It then actuates joint 1, 3, and 5 to maximize velocity in the direction of the throw. During the trajectory, the grippers will open near the peak, releasing the bag. **Be sure that Sawyer's arm can be fully extended in all directions without hitting anything in the environment before running.**

Sawyer will also attempt to target the cornhole board and it will also make adjustments based on the result of each throw by referencing the respective April tags. These features are both accomplished using the distance and heading calculations between sawyer, the board, and the most recently thrown bag.

# Manipulation

# Notes
## Lessons Learned
 - Throwing is a task so intuitive for a human that we rarely stop to realize the complexities of what is actually happening. The amount of hand control and sensory feedback a person has and can actually interpret far surpasses what a robot has access to. That being said, the great advantage a robot has over a person is the precision and repeatability.

## Future Work
 - The targeting features are currently restricted to the area to Sawyer's front left. For further development, we would ideally have the head camera scan until it found the board then select a throwing configuration based on that.
 - Also we would like to try to remove the dependency on April tags. This may prove to be too difficult for the bag detection with Sawyer's built in cameras, but the board should be possible.

# Development Notes


## Getting started
Fork the GitHub Classroom repository from [here](https://github.com/ME495-EmbeddedSystems/the-mighty-sawyer.git).  This means that you are creating a clone of the entire Classroom repo and placing a copy in your own personal GitHub repo; this is called a fork.  You will be mostly working with the fork you have created during development.

Once you have forked our official project repo to your personal repo, you can now clone your personal repo to your local machine.
```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/the-mighty-sawyer.git
```

You can also use `wstool set` so that your personal repo is added to the `.rosinstall` file.

To be able to interact with the official GitHub Classroom project repo, we have to take an additional step -- ie. add a remote upstream.

1. Open Terminal.
2. You can see the current configured remote repo for your fork by
```
git remote -v
> origin  https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/the-mighty-sawyer.git (fetch)
> origin  https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/the-mighty-sawyer.git (push)
```
3. Now you can set up a new remote `upstream` repo that can be synced with your fork
```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ME495-EmbeddedSystems/the-mighty-sawyer.git
```
4. Check whether you did this successfully
```
git remote -v
> origin	https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/the-mighty-sawyer.git (fetch)
> origin	https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/the-mighty-sawyer.git (push)
> upstream	https://github.com/ME495-EmbeddedSystems/the-mighty-sawyer.git (fetch)
> upstream	https://github.com/ME495-EmbeddedSystems/the-mighty-sawyer.git (push)
```

## Syncing your fork with the upstream repo
If the `upstream` manages to somehow become ahead of your fork repo, here's how you can catch up.

1. Open Terminal.
2.
```
roscd the-mighty-sawyer
```
or
```
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/the-mighty-sawyer/
```
3. Fetch the branches and commits from `upstream`. This step will be store the commits in a local branch, `upstream/master`.
```
git fetch upstream
```
4. Switch to `master` branch locally
```
git checkout master
```
5. Now you can merge the changes from `upstream/master` to your _local_ `master`.  This brings your fork's master branch into sync with the `upstream` repo -- _without_ losing your local changes.
```
git merge upstream/master
```
If you notice a "fast-forward" that just means you have not had any unique local commits.
6. If you'd like to also push these updates you made locally to your personal repo (recommended), you can simply do that by
```
git push -u origin master
```
